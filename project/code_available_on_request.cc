// This was a project for a University of Waterloo object-oriented programming course, CS246.
// 
// The rules of my university do not allow me to share code publicly on the internet as it would compromise
// their academic integrity rule, Policy 71.
//
// For this reason, I am providing the code for the project on request. Just shoot me a message and I'll send it over.
//
// You can also get information about the project via the README.
